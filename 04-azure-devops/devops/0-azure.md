## What is DEVOPS

DevOps is more of a framework than anything else. It also includes a standardized vocabulary and a standardized set of practices. That framework, that vocabulary, those practices are designed to reduce the time between committing a software change and the time that change is placed into the production environment, while at the same time ensuring high quality.

- With DevOps, as the name implies, the two silos become one. Development and operations are combined into an entity that can do continuous deployment and continuous improving of the software.

- So the benefits of DevOps organization are that the time to market for the code and features of products is reduced. The quality of that code is improved because a lot of problems are cought early on in the development pipeline.

- And then as a result of those two things, you have a better culture at work. Less friction between departments, less burnout, you are not constantly fighting fires and you have a much better chance of forming a collaborative environment rather than a culture of blame.

So in the Azure environment, we are going to be encountering a specific set of tools that represents one way of creating a DevOps organization.

- Azure Boards - Track Work
- Repos - Cloud-Based Source Control
- Pipelines - Build and Deploy
- Testplans - Test Apps
- Artifacts
- Integrations / Extensions
  - Slack
  - Trello
  - Campfire
  - Github

## Conclusion

**DevOps is a framework that can utilize lots of tools**

As you leverage DevOps for your teams, you may encounter tools and terms like

- Docker
- Maven
- Kubernates
- NuGet
- Node.js,
- Terraform
- Salt
- Chef
- Ansible
- Puppet

You could use this foundation to add tools to the tool belt, to read documentation on Docker, for example, and understand how it might fit into the DevOps ecosystem.

You may even want to use this foundation to pursue a certification on Azure DevOps.
